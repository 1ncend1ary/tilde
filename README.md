# Tilde

Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)&mdash;the idea
is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Basic Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites and
their keys, press `?`. If your input doesn&rsquo;t match any of the keys, a
generic DuckDuckGo search will be triggered. For example:

- Entering `t` would redirect you to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/home).
- Entering `u` would redirect you to
  [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/images).
- Entering `google` would
  [search DuckDuckGo for google](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google).

### Searching

You can search a site by typing a single quote after the site&rsquo;s key,
followed by your query. For example:

- Entering `g'tilde` would
  [search GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
- Entering `y'vox` would
  [search YouTube for vox](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vox).

### Specific Paths

You can go to a specific path on a site by typing a forward slash after the
site&rsquo;s key, followed by the location on the site you&rsquo;d like to be
redirected to. For example:

- Entering `r/r/startpages` would redirect you to
  [www.reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
- Entering `h/popular` would redirect you to
  [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular).

### Specific Sites

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or
URL. For example:

- Entering `stallman.org` would redirect you to
  [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/).
- Entering `https://smile.amazon.com` would redirect you to
  [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/).
