Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)&mdash;the idea
is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Basic Usage

### Searching

Search a site by typing a single quote after the site&rsquo;s key, followed by
your query.

  [search YouTube for vox](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vox).

### Specific Paths

Go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the
site&rsquo;s key, followed by a path.
